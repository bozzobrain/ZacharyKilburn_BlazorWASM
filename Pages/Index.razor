				<h1> Who am I?</h1>
				<p>
					
					Since I was very young, I was always intrigued with how things worked. Taking things apart as a kid always got me into trouble, and I am pleased to say that now it tends to be encouraged.<br /><br />

					For the past 5 years I have made electrical engineering not only my job, but my most enjoyed hobby. Many board designs, much 3D printing and code hackery have brought me a lot of joy, despite the constant feeling that everything has already been done before.<br /><br />

					My dream in life has always been to be part of something greater and provide new technology to humanity, which I still strive for in my work and in my hobbies. Any chance I can get to pursue this objective is an opportunity that I am willing to take.<br /><br />
