			<p>
				I am an experienced engineer with hands-on learning on and off the job.
				I have a mixture of embedded software and electrical design experience that allows me to understand both domains and how they interact.
				I have a passion for learning and extensive experiential knowledge.
				I thrive when presented with a challenge and am persistent when finding a solution, finding it hard to quit until the problem has been resolved.
				I am ready to find a challenging position where I can bring my passion and exercise my curiosity. <br />
